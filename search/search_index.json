The main directory where all Chakshu-related files are stored is located at: /home/apps/chakshu This documentation focuses on the specific services related to Chakshu, which are found under: /home/apps/chakshu/systemd_services Cluster Structure Before diving into the services, it's important to understand the general structure of the cluster and how different nodes are connected. Nodes Overview Login Node : When you log in to the cluster, you typically land on the login node. However, for managing Chakshu services, the login node is not required. Mgmt Node : This is the primary node used for managing Chakshu-related services. Master Node : In some clusters, Chakshu services might be present on the master node instead of the mgmt node. Node Usage Mgmt Node : This is the preferred node for managing Chakshu services. Master Node : If the services are not found on the mgmt node, check the master node. Chakshu Services The following are the key services related to Chakshu that can be found on either the mgmt or master node but mostly present on mgmt nodes: 1. gunicornd.service Description : This service starts the C-Chakshu Server using gunicorn . Commands: sudo systemctl start gunicornd.service sudo systemctl stop gunicornd.service sudo systemctl status gunicornd.service 2. master-chakshud.service Description : This service runs the aquire_general_data.py script, which is essential for data acquisition in Chakshu. Commands: sudo systemctl start master-chakshud.service sudo systemctl stop master-chakshud.service sudo systemctl status master-chakshud.service 3. mongod.service Description : This service activates the MongoDB Database Server, which is crucial for storing and managing data used by Chakshu. Commands: sudo systemctl start mongod.service sudo systemctl stop mongod.service sudo systemctl status mongod.service 4. node-chakshud.service Description: This service is deployed on CN, GPU, and HM nodes and runs the aquire_node_data.py script for data collection. Managing Services on CN, GPU, and HM Nodes: Get Node Information: Use sinfo to format node information for pdsh: sinfo -o %N check Service Status: From the master node, use pdsh to check the status of node-chakshud.service on CN, GPU, and HM nodes. Note that you need root privileges: sudo pdsh -w cn[001-235],gpu[01-23],hm[001-255] \"systemctl status node-chakshud.service\" Copy Service File: If the service file is not present on the nodes, copy it to /etc/systemd/system: sudo pdsh -w cn[001-235],gpu[01-23],hm[001-255] \"cp /home/apps/chakshu/systemd_services/node-chakshud.service /etc/systemd/system\" Reload Systemd: After adding or modifying service files, reload the systemd manager configuration: sudo pdsh -w cn[001-235],gpu[01-23],hm[001-255] \"systemctl daemon-reload\" Start the Service: sudo pdsh -w cn[001-235],gpu[01-23],hm[001-255] \"systemctl start node-chakshud.service\" Stop the Service: sudo pdsh -w cn[001-235],gpu[01-23],hm[001-255] \"systemctl stop node-chakshud.service\" Restart the Service: sudo pdsh -w cn[001-235],gpu[01-23],hm[001-255] \"systemctl restart node-chakshud.service\"","title":"Chakshu Services Documentation"},{"location":"#chakshu-services-documentation","text":"","title":"Chakshu Services Documentation"},{"location":"#overview","text":"Chakshu is installed on almost every cluster we manage.
